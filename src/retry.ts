 * Resolve the wait before a mid-stream retry, preferring a server-stated delay.
 *
 * A modeled `ThrottlingException` carries `retryAfterMilliseconds`: the service
 * stating how long its throttle window is. Computing our own exponential
 * backoff instead retries *inside* that window, which is throttled again — the
 * retry attempt is spent rather than used, and the caller pays the full retry
 * budget without ever getting a response. When the server states a delay, that
 * value wins over the computed backoff.
 *
 * The stated delay is clamped to `maxMs`. That cap is a liveness guard: an
 * unbounded server-controlled sleep would let one frame park the stream for
 * arbitrarily long. The tradeoff is real and deliberate — a stated delay longer
 * than `maxMs` is truncated, so for those we still retry before the window
 * elapses, exactly as before. The cap bounds the damage; it does not make a
 * long throttle window fully honored.
 *
 * Absent, negative, and non-finite values are not usable delays and fall back to
 * the computed backoff. An explicit `0` is a real instruction ("retry now") and
 * is honored as such — distinct from absent — since the retry count remains
 * bounded by the caller's `maxRetries`.
