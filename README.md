# pi-provider-kiro

A [pi](https://shittycodingagent.ai/) provider extension that connects pi to the **Kiro API** (AWS CodeWhisperer/Q), exposing **12 kiro-cli-verified models** through one provider surface.

## Why this exists

Kiro gives you a strong free model menu, but pi needs a provider that speaks Kiro's auth, model catalog, and streaming protocol cleanly. `pi-provider-kiro` handles that bridge, including:

- AWS Builder ID, IAM Identity Center, Google, and GitHub login flows
- shared credentials from an existing `kiro-cli` session when available
- reasoning-aware streaming
- region-aware model filtering so pi only shows models your Kiro region can actually use
- monthly credit totals via `/kiro-usage`
- exact fractional credit usage after each settled agent interaction, including in-process foreground subagents

## Quick start

Install the provider:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-provider-kiro
```

Or install it globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g pi-provider-kiro
```

Then log in from pi:

```text
/login kiro
```

The login flow supports:
- **AWS Builder ID** — native device-code flow, works well over SSH/remotes
- **Your organization** — IAM Identity Center start URL
- **Google** — social login via `kiro-cli`
- **GitHub** — social login via `kiro-cli`

If you already use [kiro-cli](https://kiro.dev), the provider can reuse those credentials instead of forcing a second login.

## Models

| Family | Models | Context | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Claude Opus | `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-opus-4-6` | 1M | ✓ |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 1M | ✓ |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | `claude-sonnet-4-5` | 200K | ✓ |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | `claude-sonnet-4` | 200K | ✓ |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` | 200K | ✗ |
| DeepSeek 3.2 | `deepseek-3-2` | 164K | ✓ |
| MiniMax | `minimax-m2-1`, `minimax-m2-5` | 196K | ✗ |
| GLM 5 | `glm-5` | 200K | ✓ |
| Qwen3 Coder | `qwen3-coder-next` | 256K | ✓ |
| Auto | `auto` | 1M | ✓ |

All listed models are free to use through Kiro.

## Usage

Once logged in, select any Kiro model in pi:

```text
/model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Or let Kiro pick automatically:

```text
/model auto
```

Reasoning is automatically enabled for supported models. Use `/reasoning` to adjust the thinking budget.

### Credit usage

When a Kiro model is selected, pi's footer includes a provider status such as:

```text
[Kiro: session 2.5 credits · month 48.75/1000]
```

The session total is stored in pi's session data after each settled interaction, so it survives exit/resume and follows the active branch when using `/tree`. Monthly usage is refreshed after settled Kiro work and when the command below runs.

Show both the persisted session total and the authoritative current-month Kiro usage:

```text
/kiro-usage
```

After each agent interaction settles, the provider also reports that turn's sum of Kiro's streamed fractional credit metering events. This includes foreground subagents run in the same pi process. Detached background agents that continue after the primary interaction settles are not assigned to that completed turn; `/kiro-usage` remains the authoritative account total.

## Retry Behavior

Generic transient retries such as HTTP `429` and `5xx` are handled by `pi-coding-agent` at the session layer.

This provider only keeps local recovery for Kiro-specific cases:
- `403` auth races, where it can refresh credentials from `kiro-cli`
- first-token / stalled-stream recovery
- empty-stream retries
- non-retryable Kiro body markers like `MONTHLY_REQUEST_COUNT` and `INSUFFICIENT_MODEL_CAPACITY`

## Development

```bash
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript
npm run check       # Type check (no emit)
npm test            # Run the Vitest suite
npm run test:watch  # Watch mode
```

## Architecture

The extension is organized as one feature per file:

```
src/
├── index.ts            # Extension registration
├── models.ts           # 12 model definitions + ID resolution
├── oauth.ts            # Multi-provider auth (Builder ID / Google / GitHub)
├── kiro-cli.ts         # kiro-cli credential sharing

├── event-parser.ts     # Kiro stream event parser
├── metering.ts         # Per-interaction fractional credit accounting
├── usage.ts            # Monthly credit usage API
└── stream.ts           # Main streaming orchestrator
```
